        <p>
            I decided to take this class because I am passionate about web programming and software development. The idea of creating dynamic and interactive web pages has always fascinated me, and I am eager to expand my skills in this area.

            I already have some experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Next. However, I am still looking forward to learning more skills in designing and API's.
